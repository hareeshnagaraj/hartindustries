<div class="about_thirdContainer">
	<div class="about_thirdContainer_description" style="padding-bottom:50px;">
		In 1983 Hart acquired its first wide web, four color printing press. This allowed Hart to print label end tapes for the manufacturers of gypsum board. The business continued to grow and expanded into other new markets which required the acquisition of faster, more efficient printing and slitting equipment. As the business diversified Hart Industries was relocated to Owings Mills, MD in 1989.<br><br>In 2005, at a customer's request, we were asked to explore the feasibility of producing specialty coated papers. Research into the wax coated market uncovered an opportunity for a supplier who was committed to great customer service and willing to work with the customer to improve the customer's processes. Since then Hart has identified various sub-markets within the coated market that seem to fit our strengths. These sub-markets include cubed and twisted candy and gum wrappers, cough drop wrappers, throat lozenge wrappers, and waxed sheets with improved grease hold out for some of our dairy customers. The decision to add coated products to our offerings required custom designed and engineered coaters placed in line with our current printing presses. This allows Hart to efficiently process high quality graphics with a variety of coatings.
