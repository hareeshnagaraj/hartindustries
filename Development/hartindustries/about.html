Since then Hart has identified various sub-markets within the coated market that seem to fit our strengths. These sub-markets include cubed and twisted candy and gum wrappers, cough drop wrappers, throat lozenge wrappers, and waxed sheets with improved grease hold out for some of our dairy customers.
